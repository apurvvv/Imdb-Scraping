# Imdb-Scraping
 Here is my small project in which I scrape out the movie details from IMDb website through xpath. Then the movie details (i.e movie name, movie star, movie description and picture) are saved in the database and displayed on the website. Options for adding a new movie, deleting an existing movie, downloading a CSV file for the movie are included. Also, Django RestFramework is implemented for a full-fledged crud operation. This project has been successfully tested on Postman.

To Run the django project go to the scrapeimdb directory and type python3 manage.py runserver
